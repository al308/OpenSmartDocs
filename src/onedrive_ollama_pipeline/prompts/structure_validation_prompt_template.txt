Expected validation schema:
{schema_json}

Plan summary and operations:
{plan_json}

Existing folders (sorted): {existing_folders}

For `copy_file` actions, remember that execution performs:
- `download_sorted_file(source_relative_path)`
- `upload_bytes_to_sorted(target_name, folder_path=target_folder)`

For `create_folder` actions, execution calls:
- `ensure_sorted_subfolder(path)`

Review the plan for the following:
- Are folder creations meaningful and non-duplicate?
- Do copy destinations exist or get created in this plan?
- Do filenames keep their original extensions and include the date prefix?
- Would any operation fail due to missing folders or unsupported actions?
- Are there obvious mis-classifications or missing groupings?

Respond with JSON containing:
- `"status"`: `"ok"`, `"warn"`, or `"error"`
- `"notes"`: concise explanation
- `"issues"`: array of specific concerns (empty if none)
